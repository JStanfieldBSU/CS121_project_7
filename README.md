### sort
```
implement a sort algo.
professor probably wants bubble sort. would it be blackbelt to learn insertion?
figure out how to alphabetize the creditHours with same int.
should this be two different functions for sorting alphabet vs by int.

while(keepGoing)
  something
  something
  something
```

### studentSwap(Student a, Student b)
```
create a temporary student variable 'temp'
set temp to student a
set student a to student b
set student b to temp
```

## Student.cpp
```
cool student code goes here

the student constructor should only seed the properties that are not related to other objects 
or maybe since the properties are pointers, they should be created in the constructor and then modified in the init?

Student Constructor
  studentString = "Place,Holder,1234 Lorem Ipsum,Dolor,SIT,00000,99/99/9999,11/11/1111,255";
  firstName = "Error";
  lastName = "Bug";
  Address home;
  Date birth;
  Date grad;
  creditHours = 777;

student init
  init accepts the string read from a line of the csv
  sstream
  temp string sCredit
  then use getline with a comma delimiter to get each necessary string and place it in the proper space. should look something like
  firstName = getline
  lastName = getline
  home.init(getline, getline, getline, getline)
  birth.init(getline)
  grad.init(getline)
  getline(ss, sCredit, '\n')
  clear and set ss string to ""
  put sCredit into ss
  push ss out to creditHours to convert to int
  
print Student
  print first name last name new line
  call printAddress from home
  print "DOB: " and then call printDateAlternate from birth
  print "Grad: " and then call printDateAlternate from grad
  print "Credits: " and then print creditHours

getters (studentString, firstName, lastName, creditHours)
  seems self explanatory, simply return the value of sought property
setters (studentString, firstName, lastName, creditHours)
  also seems self explanatory, but take the variable passed and assign it to the relevant property
```

## Address.cpp
```
include the header and iostream

define the constructor for Address
  street = "placeholderStreet";
  city = "placeholderCity";
  state = "placeholderState";
  zip = "placeholderZip";

define the init
  accepting data from the bigger box of Student, place it into the following variables
  street, city, state, and zip in that order.

define print address
  print the properties of the class in the following order and syntax
  'street', 'city' 'state' 'zip'

getters (street, city, state, zip)
  seems self explanatory, simply return the value of sought property

setters (street, city, state, zip)
  also seems self explanatory, but take the variable passed and assign it to the relevant property
```

## Date.cpp
```
include the header, iostream, string, and sstream

define the constructor for Date
  datestring = "12345678";
  day = 00;
  month = 00;
  year = 0000;

define the init
  accepting datestring from the input, split it apart and place it into its proper spaces.
  define a sstream to parse the data
  define three temporary strings for day month and year
  assign the input datestring to the property datestring
  write the data within datestring to sstream
  getline sstream with the end character / twice and assign to day and month
  getline sstream with the end character \n to grab the year
  clear and set sstream string to ""
  place each temporary string into the sstream in order separated by spaces
  push sstream into the properties in the correct order

define printDate
  print day '/' month '/' year;

define printDateAlternate
  print WORDMONTH[month] ' ' day ', ' year;

getters (datestring, day, month, year)
  seems self explanatory, simply return the value of sought property

setters (datestring, day, month, year)
  also seems self explanatory, but take the variable passed and assign it to the relevant property

do i need setters? honestly probably not. probably better to keep them though. Even if they're unneccesary, they could be used for a blackbelt at the end.

maybe i could make it so you could add a second file of students and be able to see them as one list and sort them together.
